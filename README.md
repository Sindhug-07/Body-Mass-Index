# Body-Mass-Index
This project calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) using a person's height and weight. BMI is a simple health indicator that helps determine whether a person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. The tool takes user input, applies the BMI formula, and classifies the result into health categories based on standard WHO guidelines.
